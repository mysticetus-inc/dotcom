### Save time and reduce cost with simple, consistent reporting, across all environmental contractors

**Report generation can be an expensive, time consuming process**  
Traditional report creation is a complex process spanning multiple teams, data collection formats (paper, spreadsheets), and frequently requiring extensive GIS involvement. There is a time tax ($’s!) in not just the obvious data recording, but then data interpretation (short hand notes anyone?), data movement between programs, data consolidation between observers and days, quality control, GIS team contributions, and then final report generation. This demands additional expensive hours of labor in generating the required reports.

Regulatory agencies such as NMFS and BOEM have started to require weekly reports of estimated take. This involves multiplying animal population polygons against theoretical size of ensonified regions of seismic, based on actual tracklines that were covered that week. This requires GIS people to do a lot of work. Turning around reports in the required time is often challenging.

**Mysticetus automates and standardizes the report generation process**  
With Mysticetus automatic report generation – Reports are generated with the press of a single button. Mysticetus’s report generation feature also eliminates dependencies on expensive GIS services during post processing in most cases.

Report content is defined by project managers and is standardized across all environmental contractors.

**Report generation can bucket data by any field, at your discretion**  

Reports can bucket (sum up) any recorded data item. Species, counts, juveniles, observers, environment, weather, distance to shore, mitigation states, etc. Mysticetus will sum time and distance spent in any type of effort.

Any field you record, you can report on it. Mysticetus will count up anything, bucket anything, and associate those things with effort if you want.

Heck, if you record how many cups of coffee your MMOs drink, you can report on that and associate that data with sighting counts. It is totally up to the project managers.

Here is a sample effort report breaking down time and distance by Bft, visibility and vessel activity:
