### Remote Monitoring of All Operations, From Anywhere

**Mysticetus Tracks All Vessels, Aircraft and Animal Sightings**  
Mysticetus plots and shares all vessels, aircraft and any animal sightings on a shared map display. All Observers, managers and anyone with the appropriate passwords can monitor every project action, in real-time. Observers record when equipment is being deployed, when vessels are on or off work effort (survey, construction, etc.), and when and where animals are.

**Animals are accurately tracked and predicted, relative to exclusion zones, in realtime**  
Every animal sighting is accurately and instantly plotted on the map. Mysticetus predicts future motion as well, and all viewers everywhere see this in real-time. It is obvious when an animal is (or is not) within or approaching an exclusion/mitigation zone. All ambiguity and human error are replaced with clear, concise information displays.

**SecureAudit**  
Environmental Mitigation is Legal Business. If you do it wrong, you could lose your very permit to operate.

_Everything_ that happens in the field - vessel movement, workboat operational status, animal sightings, environmental mitigations - is time stamped and recorded with state-of-the-art AES-256 encryption in a replayable and unalterable audit log. All data edits are logged and audited. Should it ever become necessary to prove something happened - or did not happen - Mysticetus gives you the ability. Easily forged Excel spreadsheets and paper forms provide no such audit capability, and will be laughed out of court.
