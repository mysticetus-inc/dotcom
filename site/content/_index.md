	text="All it takes is one claim of violation and you may lose your right to operate. Protected Species Observer (PSO) data collected via paper and spreadsheets cannot be defended - they can be altered by anyone, anytime - and lawyers know this. Paper and Excel spreadsheets will be quickly dismissed in court. Mysticetus securely encrypts and audits all data in compliance with security industry standards (AES-256). Nothing can be changed without knowing precisely who, when, and how it was changed. Quickly refute unfounded claims of permit violation. Paper and Excel can't do this."
