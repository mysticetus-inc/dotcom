	subTitle="Insurance Against False Claims"
	text="All it takes is one claim of violation and you may lose your right to operate. Collected data needs repudiation to survive and challenges to authenticy. Presenting data collected via paper and spreadsheets requiring QA after the fact is difficult to defend against challenges. Mysticetus securely encrypts and records all data activity using industry standard techniques. Nothing can be changed without knowing precisely who changed it, when it was changed, and what it was and has become. Refute illegitimate claims of permit violation with confidence in your data."
