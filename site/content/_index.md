Mitigation observer data collected via paper and spreadsheets cannot be defended - they can be altered by anyone, anytime - and the opposition lawyers know this. Mysticetus securely encrypts and audits all activity using industry standard technology. Nothing can be changed without knowing precisely who, when, and how it was changed. Quickly refute illegitimate claims of permit violation with full confidence in your mitigation data. Paper and Excel can't do this."
