	subTitle="Prevent costly false shutdowns & Reduce startup delays"
	text="Shutdowns are expensive. False shutdowns must be eliminated. A PSO's decision must be based on high quality representation of a sighting relative to the vessel's mitigation zone(s). Mysticetus's industry-leading graphic display of all aspects of an operation eliminates PSO guess work and forces immediate QA on recorded data. Mysticetus integrates GPS, AIS, passive acoustic monitoring, IR cameras, real time mapping, and internet connectivity. No more scrawled notes on paper. No more random guesses in Excel. No more data translation errors."

	text="Protected Species Observers (PSOs) are your official, government-approved, onboard witnesses of legal compliance. Mysticetus double-checks and audits every PSO action and record. Paper scribbles and inauditable Excel data are easily challenged by opposing counsel. False claims can come from angry citizens with blurry photos. Or perhaps a disgruntled employee and intentionally altered data. Mysticetus time-stamps, encrypts and securely audits everything recorded by PSOs, as well as everyone who touches the data later. Mysticetus-recorded data cannot be altered without knowing who, when, where and why it was altered. This provides strongest possible protection from false claims of permit violation."

Mysticetus enforces consistent data collection that easily becomes a long range planning tool. Year over year, Mysticetus data is automatically backed up to the cloud for long-term retention and can be exported into most standard formats for ongoing analysis and planning."
