	text="It just takes one observer error to destroy an entire operation. Or if you're lucky, the error will only kill your bottom line. Mysticetus takes the guesswork out of Protected Species Observer work. No more scrawled notes on paper. No more un-auditable, critical records lost in Excel. Mysticetus integrates technologies including GPS, AIS,  passive acoustic monitoring, IR cameras, real time mapping, and internet connectivity. Mysticetus double-checks and audits everything, all the time. This reduces human errors that lead to false shutdowns or even loss of your permit to operate."

	text="Paper scribbles and un-auditable Excel data are easily tossed out of court by opposing counsel. All it takes is one angry citizen and a blurry photo to take you down. Mysticetus time-stamps, double-checks, encrypts and securely audits EVERYTHING recorded by Protected Species Observers (your official, government-approved, onboard witnesses). Mysticetus-recorded data cannot be altered without knowing who, when, where and why it was altered. This provides strong protection from false external claims of permit violation."

Mysticetus enforces a consistent data collection model that easily becomes a long range planning tool. Year over year, Mysticetus data is automatically backed up to the cloud for long-term retention and can be exported into most standard formats for ongoing analysis and planning."
