	subTitle="Make informed, defensible mitigation decisions"
	text="Your client counts on you to avoid costly judgement errors. They - and governmental regulators - also count on you to document the conditions of the permit and the law were followed. You can't do this in a legally-defensible, auditable manner with error-prone scribbles on paper or random notes in Excel. Mysticetus prevents unnecessary shutdowns and highlights your crew's professionalism by eliminating paper or spreadsheet-driven guesswork. Mysticetus was specifically designed to be used by PSOs on mitigation operations. It presents a comprehensive, crystal clear, real-time picture for all project observers - whether on vessel, in aircraft, or stationed on land."

	subTitle="Increase accuracy through your defined data collection model"
	text="Observers consistently collect data to your defined standard. Vessel and animal locations are instantly mapped, displayed and shared across connected computers around the world. Accurate sighting data validated at time of entry. Mistakes are fixed on the water, not in the office. Is it degrees/minutes/seconds or degrees/minutes? How is bearing to the sighting recorded, again? Mysticetus automatically records all the basics like date, time, distances and locations. Mysticetus doesn't allow your PSOs to do it the wrong way."
