	subTitle="Make informed, defensible mitigation decisions"
	text="Your client counts on you to avoid costly judgement errors. They - and governmental regulators - also rely on you to document the conditions of the permit and the law were followed. You can't do this in a legally-defensible fashion with error-prone scribbles on paper or random Excel notes. Mysticetus prevents unnecessary shutdowns while highlighting your crew's professionalism through their ability to make informed, clear shutdown decisions. Mysticetus was designed for PSOs on mitigation operations. It presents a comprehensive, crystal clear, real-time picture for all project observers - whether on vessel, in aircraft, or stationed on land."

	subTitle="Increase accuracy through your defined data collection model"
	text="Observers consistently collect data to your defined standard. Vessel and animal locations are instantly mapped, displayed and shared across connected computers around the world. Accurate sighting data validated at time of entry. Mistakes are fixed on the water, not in the office. Is it degrees/minutes/seconds or degrees/minutes? How is bearing to the sighting recorded, again? Mysticetus automatically records all the basics like date, time, distances and locations. Mysticetus doesn't allow your PSOs to do it the wrong way."
